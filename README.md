# Overview

Allows easy server-side logging to browsers supporting the [Chrome Logger](http://www.chromelogger.com) protocol. Either native or via plugins.


### Source

Based on [ccampbell/chromephp](http://github.com/ccampbell/chromephp), but more or less a complete rewrite because I found that one hard to extend and adjust in my own project. ðŸ˜Ÿ

Ended up using newer PHP features and simplifying it a bit too, because that's how I roll.

Also called it `ConsoleLog` because I find it weird to use `Chrome` and `Php` in my code, when already writing PHP and I'm viewing the messages in the native Developer Console in FireFox... ðŸ¤” ðŸ™‚



# Usage

```php

use Geekality\ConsoleLog;

ConsoleLog::info('Hello console!');
ConsoleLog::log($_SERVER);
ConsoleLog::warn('something is off with', $object);
ConsoleLog::error('fail');

ConsoleLog::group('Group header');
ConsoleLog::log('Bar');
ConsoleLog::groupEnd();

```
